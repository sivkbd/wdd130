        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3> 

        <p>Since 2023, Iâ€™ve been designing unique pieces reflecting the styles and vibes of George.
        I grew up with a strong curiosity and eagerness about the world of design, and began crafting stylish clothing and jewelry samples at a young age. 
        I love working with others, having to brainstorm ideas about new style of fashion in order to create collaborative pieces that not only inspire,
        but empower those who see the world and live life  through beautiful fashion.</p>
            

        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3> 
        <p class="colored"> 
        what drives us to be unique tis that our fashion styles are in the expense of the people's fashion desire.
        No matter what type of style and look you are seeking, The Idea Shop Company can create and make it happen for you.

        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>Who are we?</p>
        <p>The idea shop was started back in 2000. The idea of this business was to bring and help out the young people.
          There is so much talent that young people tend to waste because they have no one to guide them and help them 
          make positive change in their lives.because of the taste of the fahion and style they were attracted and desire 
          to have, I saw the opportunity to come in and help them with their ideas and desires. They were creative on how they wear their clothes and how they look in style of their own.As a results
          some other kids wanted the same style but it's the style and fashion that is not available. So I decided to start something 
          that will be of help to young people. I went to schools looking for the talented young fashionist and groomed them and gave them
          the opportunity to develop their talent and actually create it and sew it, so that everyone could get it. 
          As a results we have achieved alot and the aim is to be known and seen as the world's in-demand fashionist.
          We are young, creative and best at bringing change with new ideas of styles in the fashion business.
