        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3> 

        <p>Since 2000, Iâ€™ve been designing unique pieces reflecting the styles and vibes of George.
        I grew up with a strong curiosity and eagerness about the world of design, and began crafting stylish clothing and jewelry samples at a young age. 
        I love working with others, having to brainstorm ideas about new style of fashion in order to create collaborative pieces that not only inspire,
        but empower those who see the world and live life  through beautiful fashion.</p>
            

        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3> 
        <p class="colored"> 
        what drives us to be unique to trips exclusively for 
        physically fit and experienand different, is that our fashion styles are in the expense of the people's fashion desire.
        No matter what type of style and look you are seeking, The Idea Shop Company can create and make it happen for you.
