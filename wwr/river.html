            <h1>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h1> 

                <p> Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. 
                High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery,
                interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                
                <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.</p>

                <p> Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. 
                    This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>
