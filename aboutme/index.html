    <p>Hi everyone. It's great to know you all. I'm from South Africa, 
        I' married and we have 4 kids ages- 7, 5, 2 and 1 year old. 
        They keep us very busy and they are noisy sometimes but it's always fun having them around. 
        Sometimes we wish they stay young. But what can we do, they must grow. I have been a member for 13 years now. 
        And all I can say is that, joining the church of Jesus christ of latter day saints. It's the best decision, I have ever made in my life.</p> 

    <p>I work as a site clerk for a construction company. Most of my time, I spent her at work. Because we travel a lot and get to work from town to town. 
        But on the weekends, I get to go home and spent time with my family. 
        I love playing soccer and watch movies and series with my wife. I eat a lot and like to sing. Thank you and I appreciate you looking at my web page.</p>
